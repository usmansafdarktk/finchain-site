## 🔍 Overview

**FinChain** is the first benchmark designed for **verifiable chain-of-thought (CoT) financial reasoning**.  
It evaluates large language models on symbolic, multi-step problem-solving tasks grounded in financial equations.  
Built from scratch using a fine-grained financial taxonomy, FinChain enables step-level supervision and robust diagnostic evaluation.
